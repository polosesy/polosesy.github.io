You have access to multiple clusters from your main terminal through kubectl contexts. Write all those context names into /opt/course/1/contexts.
Next write a command to display the current context into /opt/course/1/context_default_kubectl.sh, the command should use kubectl.
Finally write a second command doing the same thing into /opt/course/1/context_default_no_kubectl.sh, but without the use of kubectl.

<summary> Q.4 : 
Task weight: 4%
Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H
Do the following in Namespace default. Create a single Pod named ready-if-service-ready of image nginx:1.16.1-alpine. Configure a LivenessProbe which simply runs true. Also configure a ReadinessProbe which does check if the url http://service-am-i-ready:80 is reachable, you can use wget -T2 -O- http://service-am-i-ready:80 for this. Start the Pod and confirm it isn't ready because of the ReadinessProbe.
Create a second Pod named am-i-ready of image nginx:1.16.1-alpine with label id: cross-server-ready. The already existing Service service-am-i-ready should now have that second Pod as endpoint.
Now the first Pod should be in ready state, confirm that.

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H
Ssh into the master node with ssh cluster1-master1. Check how the master components kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and etcd are started/installed on the master node. Also find out the name of the DNS application and how it's started/installed on the master node.
Write your findings into file /opt/course/8/master-components.txt. The file should be structured like:

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC
Ssh into the master node with ssh cluster2-master1. Temporarily stop the kube-scheduler, this means in a way that you can start it again afterwards.
Create a single Pod named manual-schedule of image httpd:2.4-alpine, confirm its created but not scheduled on any node.
Now you're the scheduler and have all its power, manually schedule that Pod on node cluster2-master1. Make sure it's running.
Start the kube-scheduler again and confirm its running correctly by creating a second Pod named manual-schedule2 of image httpd:2.4-alpine and check if it's running on cluster2-worker1.

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H
Use Namespace project-tiger for the following. Create a DaemonSet named ds-important with image httpd:2.4-alpine and labels id=ds-important and uuid=18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462. The Pods it creates should request 10 millicore cpu and 10 mebibyte memory. The Pods of that DaemonSet should run on all nodes, master and worker.

<details markdown="1">
<summary> Q.12 : 
Task weight: 6%

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H

Use Namespace project-tiger for the following. Create a Deployment named deploy-important with label id=very-important (the Pods should also have this label) and 3 replicas. It should contain two containers, the first named container1 with image nginx:1.17.6-alpine and the second one named container2 with image kubernetes/pause.

There should be only ever one Pod of that Deployment running on one worker node. We have two worker nodes: cluster1-worker1 and cluster1-worker2. Because the Deployment has three replicas the result should be that on both nodes one Pod is running. The third Pod won't be scheduled, unless a new worker node will be added.

In a way we kind of simulate the behaviour of a DaemonSet here, but using a Deployment and a fixed number of replicas.

<summary> Q.13 : 
Task weight: 4%

Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H

Create a Pod named multi-container-playground in Namespace default with three containers, named c1, c2 and c3. There should be a volume attached to that Pod and mounted into every container, but the volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other Pods.

Container c1 should be of image nginx:1.17.6-alpine and have the name of the node where its Pod is running available as environment variable MY_NODE_NAME.

Container c2 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and write the output of the date command every second in the shared volume into file date.log. You can use while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done for this.

Container c3 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and constantly send the content of file date.log from the shared volume to stdout. You can use tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log for this.

Check the logs of container c3 to confirm correct setup.

There was a security incident where an intruder was able to access the whole cluster from a single hacked backend Pod.
